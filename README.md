Protected routes require Authorization: Bearer <token>

Admin-only endpoints for managing users, amenities, and viewing all data

Passwords stored hashed using bcrypt

Admin user creation example provided with password hashing snippet

Database Setup
SQL scripts to create tables and insert initial data (create_schema.sql, insert_initial_data.sql)

Frontend Application (Part 4)
Overview
The frontend is a React-based single page application that interfaces with the HBnB backend API to provide a rich user experience:

User registration and login with JWT authentication

Browse, filter, and search listings of places

View place details, amenities, and reviews

Submit reviews and manage bookings

Admin dashboard for managing users, places, amenities, and reviews

Responsive design and client-side routing

Features
Authentication: Login form stores JWT, protects routes client-side

Listings Page: Display places with filtering by price, amenities, location

Place Details: Detailed info with reviews and amenities

Review Submission: Authenticated users can add/edit/delete reviews

Admin Panel: Manage users, places, and amenities with elevated rights

State Management: Uses React Context or Redux for global state

Error Handling: User-friendly error messages on failed requests

Testing: Frontend unit tests for components and integration with backend mocks

Tech Stack
React + React Router for SPA routing

Axios or Fetch API for HTTP requests to backend

JWT stored in localStorage or secure HTTP-only cookies

CSS Modules / Styled Components / Tailwind CSS for styling (depending on implementation)
